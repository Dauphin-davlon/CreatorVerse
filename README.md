## Notes

During the development of my React app, I encountered several challenges that required problem-solving and creative solutions. One major issue was ensuring that elements, such as the "View Details" link, were correctly displayed within my components. This was complicated by CSS issues that affected the layout and visibility of certain elements. Additionally, integrating Supabase with my React app presented challenges, particularly in fetching data from the database and managing error handling and loading states effectively.

Styling the app using PicoCSS also posed difficulties. I needed to manage custom properties and ensure a consistent and visually appealing design across various components. Another significant challenge involved implementing image handling and storage, allowing users to upload or capture images, store them in Supabase's image storage, and display them within the app. This required careful management of file inputs, image URLs, and integration with cloud storage services.

Creating a responsive grid layout for displaying creator cards was another hurdle. I had to ensure the layout was well-spaced, aligned, and adaptable to different screen sizes. Implementing navigation using React Router was also a key focus, where setting up routes and ensuring smooth page transitions proved to be complex. Finally, handling errors gracefully and providing clear user feedback, especially during backend interactions, was crucial in delivering a seamless user experience.
